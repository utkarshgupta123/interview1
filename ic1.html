    <h1>Html Interview Questions</h1>
    <p></p>

    Ques-1. Difference between div and span
    <p>ans-1: Span and div are both generic HTML elements that group together related parts of a web page. 
        However, they serve different functions. A div element is used for block-level organization and styling of page elements, 
        whereas a span element is used for inline organization and styling</p>
    Ques-2. Difference between class and IDs
    <p> ans-2: The difference between an ID and a class is that an ID is only used to identify one single element in our HTML. 
        IDs are only used when one element on the page should have a particular style applied to it. 
        However, a class can be used to identify more than one HTML element.</p>
    Ques-3. What are self closing tags
    <p> ans-3: A self-closing tag is an element of HTML code that has evolved in the language. 
        Typically, the self-closing tag makes use of a “/” character in order to 
        effectively close out a beginning tag enclosed in sideways carets.</p>
    Ques-4. How many types of headings are der ?How to decide which to use where 
    <p>ans-4:HTML defines six levels of headings. A heading element implies all the font changes, paragraph breaks before and after, 
        and any white space necessary to render the heading. 
        The heading elements are H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6 with H1 being the highest (or most important) level and H6 the least.</p>
    Ques-5. Difference between block and inline
    <p>ans-5: inline-block It's formatted just like the inline element, where it doesn't start on a new line.
         BUT, you can set width and height values. block The element will start on a new line and occupy the full width available. 
         And you can set width and height values</p>
    Ques-6. Difference between em and strong
    <p>ans-6: The  tag should be used to indicate strong importance, seriousness, or urgency, 
        like to indicate key phrases in a text for someone skimming it.
         The  tag should be used to represent stress emphasis, like when you'd read the emphasized text in a different tone of voice.</p>
    Ques-7. What are attributes?
    <p>ans-7: All HTML elements can have attributes
    Attributes provide additional information about elements
    Attributes are always specified in the start tag
    Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"</p>
    
    Ques-8. Difference between HTML tags and elements
    <p> ans-8: Technically, an HTML element is the collection of start tag, its attributes, an end tag and everything in between. 
        On the other hand an HTML tag (either opening or closing) is used to mark the start or end of an element, 
        as you can see in the above illustration.
    However, in common usage the terms HTML element and HTML tag are interchangeable i.e. a tag is an element is a tag.
     For simplicity's sake of this website, the terms "tag" and "element" are used to mean the same thing — as it will define 
     something on your web page.</p>
    
    Ques-9. Explain br tags
    <p>ans-9: The <br> tag inserts a single line break. 
        The <br> tag is useful for writing addresses or poems.
         The <br> tag is an empty tag which means that it has no end tag.</p>
    Ques-10. Explain how many different types of lists we have in html 
    <p> ans-10: There are three list types in HTML: 
        unordered list — used to group a set of related items in no particular order. 
        ordered list — used to group a set of related items in a specific order. 
        description list — used to display name/value pairs such as terms and definitions.</p>
    Ques-11. What are semantic tags
    <p>ans-11: A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
         Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.
         Examples of semantic elements: <form> , <table> , and <article> - Clearly defines its content.</p>
